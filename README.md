- 👋 Hi, I’m @science-d
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to develop software for a research project. For my last year's project,I researched and studied alternative learning methods hoping to improve education and optimize learning. My project was successful at the state fair placing 2nd in my category. This year I hope to complete research in the same realm but with the help of intelligent digital systems. I want to develop a platform/software that is capable of cognitive diagnosis on individual students, personalized education hypermedia, and tailored feedback on whatever topics students are learning. 
- 🌱 I’m in high school and do not have much coding experience but I am willing to learn and put hours in. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my research project and I am open to any ideas about the coding or the idea itself.
